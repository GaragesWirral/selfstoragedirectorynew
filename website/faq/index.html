<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
<p>Find answers to the most common questions about self storage facilities and services.</p>
<div class="faq-container">
<div class="faq-item">
<h3>What is self storage?</h3>
<p>Self storage provides secure, accessible space for individuals and businesses to store their belongings. Units come in various sizes and are typically rented on a month-to-month basis, giving you flexibility for both short and long-term storage needs.</p>
</div>
<div class="faq-item">
<h3>What size storage unit do I need?</h3>
<p>Storage unit sizes typically range from small lockers (16 sq ft) to large units (300+ sq ft). A small 5x5 unit (25 sq ft) can fit boxes and small furniture, while a 10x10 unit (100 sq ft) can store contents of a 1-bedroom apartment. For a 3-4 bedroom house, you might need a 10x20 or larger unit. Most facilities offer size guides on their websites.</p>
</div>
<div class="faq-item">
<h3>How much does self storage cost?</h3>
<p>Storage unit prices vary by location, size, features, and demand. In the UK, prices typically range from £50-£100/month for small units to £200-£400/month for large units. Climate-controlled units and facilities in urban areas generally cost more than standard units in rural areas.</p>
</div>
<div class="faq-item">
<h3>Do I need insurance for my stored items?</h3>
<p>Most facilities require you to have insurance for your stored belongings. Many offer insurance plans you can purchase, or you may be able to use your existing homeowner's or renter's insurance policy. Check with your insurance provider to see if your policy covers items in storage.</p>
</div>
<div class="faq-item">
<h3>What security features should I look for?</h3>
<p>Look for facilities with 24/7 CCTV monitoring, gated access with individual entry codes, good lighting, on-site management, and individual unit alarms. Some premium facilities also offer biometric security measures and motion sensors.</p>
</div>
<div class="faq-item">
<h3>Can I access my storage unit anytime?</h3>
<p>Access hours vary by facility. Many offer extended access from early morning to late evening, while some provide 24/7 access. Premium facilities in urban areas are more likely to offer round-the-clock access. Check the specific access hours before renting.</p>
</div>
<div class="faq-item">
<h3>What can't I store in a self storage unit?</h3>
<p>Prohibited items typically include perishable food, live animals, plants, hazardous materials, flammable or combustible items, illegal substances, and unregistered vehicles. Some facilities may have additional restrictions, so always check their specific policies.</p>
</div>
<div class="faq-item">
<h3>Do I need climate control?</h3>
<p>Climate-controlled units maintain consistent temperature and humidity levels, protecting sensitive items from extreme conditions. Consider climate control for storing electronics, wooden furniture, musical instruments, artwork, photographs, important documents, clothing, and antiques.</p>
</div>
<div class="faq-item">
<h3>How long can I rent a storage unit?</h3>
<p>Most facilities offer month-to-month rentals with no minimum or maximum time requirements. This flexibility allows you to store items for as little as a month or for several years, depending on your needs.</p>
</div>
<div class="faq-item">
<h3>What happens if I miss a payment?</h3>
<p>If you miss a payment, most facilities charge late fees and restrict access to your unit. After multiple missed payments (typically 30-60 days), the facility may place a lien on your belongings and eventually auction them to recover costs. Communication is key—if you're facing payment difficulties, contact the facility manager to discuss options.</p>
</div>
<div class="faq-item">
<h3>Can I store a vehicle in a self storage unit?</h3>
<p>Many facilities offer vehicle storage options for cars, motorcycles, boats, and RVs. These may be indoor units, covered spaces, or outdoor parking areas. Vehicles must typically be registered, insured, and in working condition. Some facilities also require regular maintenance visits.</p>
